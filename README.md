# DiscordBot-Python
A discord bot built using python

Project for CMPG 323 Homework

For the homework i decided to work on a discord bot again. It was one of my earlier projects that i really enjoyed working on. However it has been a long time since i touched it and it was written using discord.py which no longer works as far as i understand. So here i have started rewriting the bot using pycord as the base.

This project solves the problem of us having to look for new bots each time we want to add new functions. Thus this bot allows me to add any functionality that i would want to my discord server without needing to add extra bots constantly.

I will not completely finish this bot for this project. I will add some minor things as a proof of concept. And i can return to it later to complete it and add any more commands i may want.

during the course of its development i will work one specific command at a time. This allows me to focus on that command before moving on and starting a new section. This allows the bot to continue working while i may make changes to a section.
